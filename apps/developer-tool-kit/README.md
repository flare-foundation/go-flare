# Next.js Admin Template with TypeScript & Shadcn UI

**Studio Admin** - Includes multiple dashboards, authentication layouts, customizable theme presets, and more.

Most admin templates I found, free or paid, felt cluttered, outdated, or too rigid. I built this as a cleaner alternative with features often missing in others, such as theme toggling and layout controls, while keeping the design modern, minimal, and flexible.

> [!TIP]
> I’m also working on Nuxt.js, Svelte, and React (Vite + TanStack Router) versions of this dashboard. They’ll be live soon.

## Features

- Built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and Shadcn UI  
- Responsive and mobile-friendly  
- Customizable theme presets (light/dark modes with color schemes like Tangerine, Brutalist, and more)  
- Flexible layouts (collapsible sidebar, variable content widths)  
- Authentication flows and screens  
- Prebuilt dashboards (Default, CRM, Finance, Analytics, Productivity) plus legacy variants  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with config-driven UI and multi-tenant support *(planned)*  

> [!NOTE]
> The default dashboard uses the **shadcn neutral** theme.  
> It also includes additional color presets inspired by [Tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com):  
>
> - Tangerine  
> - Neo Brutalism  
> - Soft Pop  
>
> You can create more presets by following the same structure as the existing ones.

> Looking for the **Next.js 15** version?  
> Check out the [`archive/next15`](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard/tree/archive/next15) branch.  
> This branch contains the setup prior to upgrading to Next 16 and the React Compiler.

> Looking for the **Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS v3** version?  
> Check out the [`archive/next14-tailwindv3`](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard/tree/archive/next14-tailwindv3) branch.  
> It has a different color theme and is not actively maintained, but I try to keep it updated with major changes.

## Colocation File System Architecture

This project follows a **colocation-based architecture** each feature keeps its own pages, components, and logic inside its route folder.  
Shared UI, hooks, and configuration live at the top level, making the codebase modular, scalable, and easier to maintain as the app grows.

For a full breakdown of the structure with examples, see the [Next Colocation Template](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-colocation-template).
