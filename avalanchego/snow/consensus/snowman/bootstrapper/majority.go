// potentially accaptable blocks into a set of accepted blocks to sync to.
//
// Once the last accepted blocks have been fetched from the initial set of
// peers, the set of blocks are sent to all peers. Each peer is expected to
// filter the provided blocks and report which of them they consider accepted.
// If a majority of the peers report that a block is accepted, then the node
// will consider that block to be accepted by the network. This assumes that a
// majority of the network is correct. If a majority of the network is
// malicious, the node may accept an incorrect block.
